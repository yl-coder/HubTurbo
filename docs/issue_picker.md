The `Issue Picker` is divided into 3 main sections:
 1. `Selected issues area` : shows issues that will be selected upon confirmation 
 2. `Query field`     : enter your query here to filter all issues in current repository 
 3. `Suggested issues area`: lists all issues that matches your query. 
 
### Selecting issues
Typing in the text field will highlight the issue that matches the query.

Clicking on a suggested issue will toggle its state and the text field will be disabled. An issue will be selected if
it is not chosen, or will be removed otherwise.
